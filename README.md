# GDTwitch

Godot to IRC to Twitch interface.

Runs a basic IRC bot that connects to the Twitch chat API.

Allows for outputting, parsing, and sending messages.

Repo includes an example scene that allows connecting to various channels, sending messages, and parsing messages for commands. "Hey Godot" (Case insensitive)

This project was inspired by https://github.com/drtwisted/godot-twicil and while following the same general logic, was written entirely from scratch with (hopefully) cleaner code.
